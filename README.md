# SwiftDataPacks

### A clean separation of user-writable SwiftData and read-only content packs, with ergonomic SwiftUI helpers for setup, filtering, and safe writes.

## Why this exists

Many apps need to present a single, unified view of data while guaranteeing that user edits can never mutate bundled or installed content. This package provides a single, composite `ModelContainer` built from the user's private, writable data store and any number of read-only "pack" stores. It includes the APIs to keep reads simple, writes safe, and pack management robust.

## Requirements

- Swift 5.10+ and SwiftData
- iOS 17+ or macOS 14+
- SwiftUI is required for the view modifiers and property wrappers

> [!WARNING]
> SwiftDataPacks uses a single ModelContainer composed of multiple underlying stores. Since SwiftData is built on Core Data and doesnâ€™t natively advertise this pattern, performance may degrade with many packs and unexpected issues can occur. This is a temporary solution for CircuitPro.

## Installation

Add the package URL to your project with Swift Package Manager. Then `import SwiftDataPacks` where needed (this automatically imports SwiftData as well).

## Core Concepts

The manager builds a **single, composite `ModelContainer`** that merges two types of data sources:
- **The User Store**: A private, read-write database located in the app's Application Support directory.
- **Content Packs**: Any number of read-only databases that can be installed or updated at runtime.

You read from this unified `mainContainer` by default and write exclusively to the user store through provided APIs that enforce this separation.

## Quick Start

```swift
import SwiftUI
import SwiftDataPacks

@main
struct MyApp: App {
    var body: some Scene {
        WindowGroup {
            ContentView()
                // The container is configured with just your model types.
                .packContainer(
                    for: [
                        YourModel.self,
                        AnotherModel.self
                    ]
                )
        }
    }
}
```

> [!WARNING]
> Do not use the default `.modelContainer()` in conjunction with `.packContainer()`, it will lead to unexpected results.

## Reading from the Unified Store

Standard `@Query` works out of the box and will fetch data from both the user's store and all installed packs.

```swift
struct ContentView: View {
    @Query(sort: \YourModel.name) var items: [YourModel]

    var body: some View {
        List(items) { item in
            Text(item.name)
        }
    }
}
```

## Safe Writes to the User Store

The `@UserContext` property wrapper is the **only** supported way to write data. It provides a safe API that guarantees all mutations only affect the user's private database.

```swift
import SwiftDataPacks

struct EditorView: View {
    @UserContext private var user

    var body: some View {
        Button("Add New Item") {
            let item = YourModel(name: "New")
            user.insert(item)
        }

        Button("Rename Item") {
            // 'existingItem' could be from a pack or the user's store.
            // This update will only apply if it's a user-owned item.
            user.update(existingItem) { $0.name = "Renamed" }
        }

        Button("Delete Item") {
            user.delete(existingItem)
        }

        Button("Batch Operation") {
            user.transaction { context in
                let a = YourModel(name: "Item A")
                let b = YourModel(name: "Item B")
                context.insert(a)
                context.insert(b)
            }
        }
    }
}
```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Calling the `insert`, `update`, or `delete` methods on `@UserContext` automatically saves changes in a safe, isolated transaction. You do not need to call save.

> [!WARNING]
> Do not use `@Environment(\.modelContext)` to perform writes. This will lead to undefined behavior, including potential attempts to write to a read-only pack, which will cause a crash.

## Filtering by Data Source in Views

Use the `.filterContainer` modifier to scope any view and its children to specific data sources.

```swift
struct LibraryView: View {
    var body: some View {
        // This list will only show items from the user's private store.
        ItemsList()
            .filterContainer(for: .mainStore)
    }
}

struct PackDetailView: View {
    let packID: UUID
    var body: some View {
        // This list will only show items from one specific pack.
        ItemsList()
            .filterContainer(for: .pack(id: packID))
    }
}

struct MixedSourcesView: View {
    let packA: UUID, packB: UUID
    var body: some View {
        // This list shows items from the user store and two specific packs.
        ItemsList()
            .filterContainer(for: .mainStore, .pack(id: packA), .pack(id: packB))
    }
}
```

## Accessing the Manager from SwiftUI

Use the `@PackManager` property wrapper to get access to the manager for listing packs or performing other operations.

```swift
struct PacksSidebar: View {
    @PackManager var manager

    var body: some View {
        List(manager.installedPacks) { pack in
            Text(pack.metadata.title)
        }
    }
}
```

## Installing and Removing Packs

The pack management functions now `throw` errors, allowing you to catch failures and present alerts to the user.

```swift
struct InstallButton: View {
    @PackManager var manager
    @State private var error: Error?

    func install(from folderURL: URL) {
        do {
            try manager.installPack(from: folderURL)
        } catch {
            self.error = error // Trigger a .alert modifier
        }
    }

    func remove(_ packID: UUID) {
        manager.removePack(id: packID)
    }
}```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> `installPack(from:)` will automatically check the pack's version. If a pack with the same ID is already installed, it will perform an update instead of installing a duplicate.

## Exporting Packs

```swift
struct ExportPackView: View {
    @PackManager var manager
    @State private var document: PackDirectoryDocument?
    @State private var filename = ""
    @State private var isExporting = false

    let packID: UUID

    var body: some View {
        Button("Export Pack") {
            if let (doc, name) = try? manager.packDirectoryDocument(for: packID) {
                document = doc
                filename = name
                isExporting = true
            }
        }
        .fileExporter(
            isPresented: $isExporting,
            document: document,
            contentType: .folder,
            defaultFilename: filename
        ) { _ in }
    }
}
```

## Mock Data for Previews and Demos

Quickly create and install a pack for testing or SwiftUI Previews.

```swift
struct MyView_Previews: PreviewProvider {
    static var previews: some View {
        MyView()
            .onAppear {
                // Using a temporary manager for the preview
                if let manager = try? SwiftDataPackManager(for: [YourModel.self]) {
                    do {
                        try manager.addMockPack(title: "Demo Components") { ctx in
                            for i in 1...10 {
                                ctx.insert(YourModel(name: "Item \(i)"))
                            }
                        }
                    } catch {
                        print("Failed to add mock pack: \(error)")
                    }
                }
            }
    }
}
```

## Error Handling and Guardrails

- The manager throws `PackManagerError` on initialization and pack operations like `installPack`.
- Installs perform an ID collision scan between the user store and the incoming pack to prevent duplicated `PersistentIdentifiers`.
- Writes through `@UserContext` automatically refuse to modify read-only pack objects by safely re-fetching the object in the user-only write context.

## Storage Layout and Lifecycle

- All data lives under Application Support in a `SwiftDataPacks` folder.
- User data is in the `Main` subdirectory, containing the `database.store`.
- Packs live in `Packs/<Title>.pack` directories.
- Deletions fall back to a "pending deletion" list when immediate removal fails, and the manager cleans up these files on the next app launch.

## API Reference Map

- **SwiftDataPackManager**: The central coordinator with `mainContainer`, `installedPacks`, and `packsDirectoryURL`.
- **Property Wrappers**: `@PackManager`, `@UserContext`.
- **View Modifiers**: `packContainer(for:)`, `filterContainer(for:)`.
- **Models**: `Pack`, `InstalledPack`, `ContainerSource`, `PackDirectoryDocument`.

## Concurrency and Performance Notes

- The manager creates a fresh, temporary `ModelContext` for every write transaction to ensure isolation and prevent concurrency issues.
- Large enumerations use batching to fetch `PersistentIdentifiers` efficiently during collision checks.

## Limitations and Gotchas

- Packs must include a `manifest.json` and the SwiftData store files (`.store`, `-wal`, and `-shm` when present).
- If you hot-swap containers by installing/removing packs in tight loops, allow the UI a cycle to update its references.
